  "My name is Chase Ohlson. Iâ€™m a frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in Los Angeles -- with roots in digital marketing & SEO. I'm passionate about music, technology and basically everything that makes the internet tick.",

  "My work currently consists of a full time engineering role at The Noun Project (working on Lingo) & managing ongoing freelance clients and side projects. I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.",

  "My freelance web development roots are in Wordpress & Shopify, of which I'm self taught. In 2017, I started at UCLA to broaden my knowledge of the Node.js ecosystem. Since then, I fell in love with & have been primarily using React & Redux in web applications. For static sites, I love using Gatsby for creating blazing fast, SEO-driven headless frontend user interfaces.",
